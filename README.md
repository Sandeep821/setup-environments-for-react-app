# Setup environment variable for React app

# Prerequisites
- Make sure `NodeJS`, `NPM`, and `env-cmd`(globally or locally) are installed and running on you local machine

# Optional Installation 
- `Yarn` (npm install -g yarn)

## Run the app (Locally)
- Open `Terminal` or `PowerShell` or `Command Line`
- Clone the project to your desired location: `https://github.com/Sandeep821/setup-environments-for-react-app.git`
- Navigate to the project: `cd vci-ofa-frontend`
- Install all the dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app locally using yarn : `yarn start-dev` | `yarn start-int` | `yarn start-cons` | `yarn start-prod`
- Run the app locally using npm : `npm run start-dev` | `npm run start-int` | `npm run start-cons` | `npm run start-prod`

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Build the app using Yran : `yarn build-dev` | `yarn build-int` | `yarn build-cons` | `yarn build-prod` to the `build` folder.
<br>
Build the app using npm : `npm run build-dev` | `npm run build-int` | `npm run build-cons` | `npm run build-prod` to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
now app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
