# Setup environment varibale for React app

# Prerequisites
- Make sure `NodeJS`, `NPM`, `YARN` and `ENV-CMD` are installed and running on you local machine

## Run the app (Locally)
- Open `Terminal` or `PowerShell` or `Command Line`
- Clone the project to your desired location: `git clone https://ilgor_vci@bitbucket.org/ilgor_vci/vci-ofa-frontend.git`
- Navigate to the project: `cd vci-ofa-frontend`
- Install all the dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app locally : `yarn start-dev` | `yarn start-int` | `yarn start-cons` | `yarn start-prod`

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
- Run the app locally using : `yarn start-dev` | `yarn start-int` | `yarn start-cons` | `yarn start-prod`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Build the app using : `yarn build-dev` | `yarn build-int` | `yarn build-cons` | `yarn build-prod` to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
